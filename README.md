# Audio-Classification-using-CNN-MLP
## Multi class audio classification using Deep Learning (CNN, MLP)

### Project Objectives: 
The objective of this project is to build a multi class classifier to identify sound
of a bee, cricket or noise.

### Dataset Description:
Given dataset contains total of 9,914 audio sample, where 3,300 belongs to Bee, 3,500 belongs to Cricket and 3,114 belongs to noise. Each audio sample is approximately about 2 sec long and has 44,100 amplitude samples/sec. Given dataset was merged and experiments were performed on 80%-20% split.
